Feature: Calculate Throughput

  Scenario: Calculate throughput by average wip and average cycle time with valid inputs # features/calculate_througput.feature:3
    Given an average wip of 1 work items in progress                                     # features/calculate_througput.feature:4
    And an average cycle time of 2 days                                                  # features/calculate_througput.feature:5
    When I calculate throughput                                                          # features/calculate_througput.feature:6
    Then throughput should be 0.5 work items per day                                     # features/calculate_througput.feature:7

1 scenario (1 undefined)
4 steps (4 undefined)
0m0.052s

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^an average wip of (\d+) work items in progress$/) do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given(/^an average cycle time of (\d+) days$/) do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

When(/^I calculate throughput$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then(/^throughput should be (\d+)\.(\d+) work items per day$/) do |arg1, arg2|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
